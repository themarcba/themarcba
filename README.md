# Marc Backes

## I'm Marc Marc Backes and I ❤️ web development!

Hi, I'm Marc, a happily married, 30-something-year-old full-stack web developer 💻 with a strong educational background in software engineering. I am doing freelance work 🚀 based in Luxembourg 🇱🇺, but I do work remotely for international clients.

I work mostly with Vue, Node, and MongoDB.

## Where to find me

I'm almost exclusively hanging out on Twitter ([@\themarcba](https://twitter.com/themarcba)). This is the easiest way to reach me.
